## Next Steps

### To See It Working:

1. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   cd mobile
   npm start
   ```

2. **Scan QR code** with Expo Go

3. **Tap the "Manage" tab** (⚙️ icon)

4. **Play with all the screens!**

### To Connect to Backend:

The screens currently use **mock data**. To connect to real API:

1. Update `src/services/api.ts` with admin endpoints
2. Replace mock data with API calls
3. Add authentication checks (only managers can access)

### To Add Authentication:

```typescript
// In ManageScreen.tsx (and others)
const user = useAuth(); // Custom hook
if (!user.isManager) {
  return <Text>Access Denied</Text>;
}
```
