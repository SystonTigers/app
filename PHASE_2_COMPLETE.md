## Known Limitations

### Using Mock Data
All four new screens currently use mock data:
- Gallery shows 5 sample albums with 6 photos
- Highlights shows 3 matches with 8 clips
- Payments shows 5 player statuses and 6 sponsors
- Shop shows 8 sample products

**To connect real data:**
1. Add backend API endpoints for:
   - `/api/v1/gallery/albums` - Photo albums
   - `/api/v1/highlights` - Video clips
   - `/api/v1/highlights/gotm` - GOTM nominees
   - `/api/v1/payments/status` - Payment status
   - `/api/v1/shop/products` - Shop items
2. Update screens to call API instead of using mock data
3. Integrate with:
   - Printify API for real product catalog
   - Payment platform API for real status
   - YouTube API for video metadata

### External Dependencies
- **Printify Store**: Requires Printify account and store setup
- **Payment Platform**: Requires payment processor integration
- **YouTube**: Videos must be uploaded to YouTube channel
- **Email**: Relies on device email client
