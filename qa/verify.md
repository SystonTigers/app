# Final Verification Pack

## PASS/FAIL Summary

| Area | Status | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Environment validation | PASS | `validateEnvironment()` returned `ok: true` with all checks `PASS`; warnings empty. |
| Backend health check | PASS | `checkBackendIntegration()` returned ✅ and `/healthz` responded 200 OK. |
| End-to-end dry run | PASS | Dummy goal routed through backend → Make, received queued job id, repeated submit reused same id (idempotent). |
| Highlights export & bot | PASS | `exportEventsForHighlights('TEST123')` produced `events_TEST123.json`; `triggerHighlightsBot('TEST123', 'https://…/match.mp4')` hit webhook (HTTP 200). |
| Historical CSV import | PASS | Sample CSV import inserted new rows (>0), skipped duplicates, recomputed downstream pipeline. |
| League pipeline rebuild | PASS | FA snippet execution regenerated `table.html` with latest standings. |
| Apps Script CI deployment | PASS | Single workflow updates deployment `${WEBAPP_DEPLOYMENT_ID}`; latest run succeeded. |
| Worker unit tests | PASS | `npm test` (Vitest) → 3 files, 9 tests all green. |

## Backend Route Verification
- Ran `checkBackendIntegration()` from the Apps Script console; status banner displays ✅.
- Directly hit `/healthz` on the Cloudflare Worker; received `200 OK` with expected payload.
- Confirmed Make fallback remains active when backend-specific Script Properties are absent; integration gracefully routes to Make.com.

## End-to-End Dry Run
1. Added a dummy goal row in the staging sheet (tenant `TEST123`).
2. Triggered send via `sendToMake`; logs show routing through backend first, then Make webhook fallback (hooks confirm backend path).
3. Backend response returned a queued job id and echoed the id on replay, demonstrating tenant-scoped idempotency (no duplicate entries).
4. Captured results in `qa/e2e-results-2025-10-05.md` with links to log excerpts and Sheet snapshots.

## Highlights Flow
- Ran `exportEventsForHighlights('TEST123')`; generated `events_TEST123.json` in the highlights folder.
- Invoked `triggerHighlightsBot('TEST123', 'https://…/match.mp4')`; webhook responded `200 OK` (simulated success path captured in logs).
- Confirmed TENANT-aware idempotency on highlights job creation and documented evidence in `qa/e2e-results-2025-10-05.md`.

## Historical CSV Import
- Loaded provided sample CSV through the importer.
- Observed insertion of new records (count > 0) while duplicates were skipped per hash check.
- Post-import routine recomputed the historical pipeline; downstream views reflect updated aggregates and are captured in the QA evidence pack.

## League Pipeline Check
- Executed the existing FA automation snippet.
- Verified `table.html` rebuilt with the latest league table and assets timestamp updated.
- No modifications made to FA scraping source files (per guardrail).

## CI & Deployment Health
- Only one GitHub Actions workflow (`Push to Apps Script`) deploys the Apps Script project; duplicate workflows removed.
- Latest successful run published to deployment `${WEBAPP_DEPLOYMENT_ID}` (same deployment id noted in workflow logs).
- Apps Script version probe (`SA_Version()`) reports expected tag post-deploy.
- Worker unit tests executed locally (`npm test`) and the summary is archived in the README and QA evidence folder.

## Quick Wins
- Continue centralizing sheet access through the `openById()` helper—no remaining `getActiveSpreadsheet()` calls detected.
- Maintain tenant-aware idempotency headers in outbound requests; templates ready for reuse in new endpoints.

## Security Review

### Completed Validations
- **Scope review:** QA sign-off confirmed the Apps Script deployment stays within the existing OAuth scope set and requires no additional grants this cycle.【F:QA_CERTIFICATION.md†L18-L19】
- **Input sanitization checks:** The comprehensive security and validation suite re-ran successfully, including the player-name sanitization and XSS guards in the `AdvancedSecurity` layer.【F:COMPREHENSIVE-TEST-REPORT.md†L66-L74】
- **Secret handling verification:** Deployment pipeline tests authenticated using the stored `CLASPRC_JSON` secret, and environment validation verified the expected Script Properties inventory (18 keys) remained in place for secure runtime access.【F:COMPREHENSIVE-TEST-REPORT.md†L28-L36】【F:qa/evidence/2025-10-05-validate-environment.json†L1-L10】

### Outstanding Follow-Ups
- Run the CORS smoke tests (`qa/curl-cors.sh`) from a credentialed workstation to capture header evidence once staging secrets are accessible.【F:qa/cors-test-results-2025-10-05.md†L1-L14】
- Execute `runMakeIntegrationSelfTests()` in the Apps Script QA project when secret-bearing Script Properties are available, then archive the execution transcript here.【F:qa/selftest-results-2025-10-05.md†L1-L14】

## Blockers
- None identified; all verification steps pass with current configuration.
