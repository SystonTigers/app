# Make Integration Self-Test Results — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- ❌ `runMakeIntegrationSelfTests()` could not be executed from the container because the staging Apps Script project is inaccessible without the required OAuth credentials and Script Properties.

## Attempt Log — 2025-10-05 02:05 UTC
- Confirmed the function definition lives in `src/qa.selftest.gs`, which must be invoked inside Google Apps Script with the staging tenant configuration loaded.
- Verified this workspace has no `~/.clasprc.json` or Script Properties for the staging tenant, so remote execution would fail authentication.
- Execution was skipped to avoid triggering calls against production webhooks without the proper sandbox bindings.

## Required Manual Steps
1. Run `runMakeIntegrationSelfTests()` within the staging Apps Script deployment that already has the correct Script Properties.
2. Download the Apps Script execution transcript (including timestamps and assertion results) and paste the raw log output into this file.
3. Re-run after ensuring the Make.com webhook credentials are valid so reviewers can see the real payload counts.
