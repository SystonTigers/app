# Historical Import QA — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- ❌ Historical CSV import was not executed because the staging Drive folder and seeded spreadsheets are inaccessible from this container.

## Attempt Log — 2025-10-05 02:05 UTC
- Reviewed the historical import instructions and confirmed they require Drive file IDs stored in Script Properties for the staging tenant.
- Checked the local environment and verified no Script Properties or OAuth grants are available, so Drive access would fail with authorization errors.
- Skipped execution to prevent accidental writes to production sheets or partial imports with missing credentials.

## Required Manual Steps
1. Launch the historical import flow from the staging Apps Script project that has the correct Drive bindings.
2. Record the before/after row counts and attach the raw Apps Script execution transcript in this file.
3. Include any webhook or error responses so reviewers can verify the data load completed successfully.
