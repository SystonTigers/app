# Highlights Export QA — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- ❌ `exportEventsForHighlights` / `triggerHighlightsBot` were not executed because required staging credentials and webhook URLs are unavailable in this environment.

## Attempt Log — 2025-10-05 02:05 UTC
- Confirmed the flow reads Script Properties for staging webhook endpoints and Drive destinations that are not present locally.
- Noted that running without the correct OAuth grants would cause UrlFetch calls to fail and could ping production webhooks.
- Execution skipped to avoid unauthorized API calls and to keep evidence aligned with secure environments.

## Required Manual Steps
1. Run `exportEventsForHighlights` followed by `triggerHighlightsBot` inside the staging Apps Script deployment.
2. Capture the full Apps Script log output (timestamps, counts, webhook responses) and paste it verbatim here.
3. Include confirmation of created highlight files or bot acknowledgements so reviewers can verify success.
