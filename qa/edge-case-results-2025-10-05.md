# Edge Case Test Harness — 2025-10-05

## Summary
- ❌ Functions in `src/edge-case-tests.gs` were not executed because the Apps Script runtime with staging Sheet data is unavailable from this container.

## Attempt Log — 2025-10-05 02:05 UTC
- Reviewed the edge-case test functions and confirmed they require SpreadsheetApp access to seeded QA sheets plus UrlFetch calls to staging webhooks.
- Verified no Google authentication context exists here (`ScriptApp`, `SpreadsheetApp`, `UrlFetchApp` are unavailable), so the tests cannot run headlessly.
- Skipped execution to avoid runtime errors and misleading artifacts.

## Required Manual Steps
1. Run each function in `src/edge-case-tests.gs` through the staging Apps Script project or its QA test runner.
2. Export the execution transcripts (logs, assertions, error output) and paste the raw data into this file.
3. Capture any Drive or webhook evidence referenced by the tests so reviewers can validate edge-case handling.
