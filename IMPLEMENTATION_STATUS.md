## Summary by Priority

### P0 (Critical — Production Blockers)
- ✅ **ALL P0 COMPONENTS OPERATIONAL**
  - HTTP Worker, Queue Consumer, Make Adapter
  - Durable Objects, Idempotency, Auth
  - Apps Script, CI/CD

### P1 (High — Near-Term Required)
- ❌ **Admin Endpoints (0%)** — Manual KV management required
- ⚠️ **Fixtures Worker Deployment (65%)** — Needs wrangler.toml
- ✅ Tenant Service (90%) — Operational
- ✅ Fixtures Service (80%) — Operational

### P2 (Medium — Enhancement)
- ⚠️ YouTube Adapter (40%) — Make.com fallback works
- ✅ Table Service (83%) — Operational
- ✅ Subscriptions Service (88%) — Operational

### P3 (Low — Future)
- ⚠️ Facebook/Instagram/TikTok (30-45%) — Make.com fallback works
- ⚠️ Canva Adapter (40%) — Make.com fallback works

---

## Production Readiness: ✅ YES

**Rationale:**
- All P0 components operational
- Make.com fallback provides full feature coverage
- CI/CD pipeline fully deployed
- Comprehensive documentation

**Caveats:**
- Admin tasks require manual KV manipulation
- Direct social media publishing falls back to Make.com
- Fixtures Worker needs deployment configuration

---

## Critical Gaps

1. **Admin Endpoints (0%)** — Priority 1, 2-3 days effort
2. **Fixtures Worker Deployment** — Priority 1, 1 day effort  
3. **Backend Test Suite** — Priority 2, 1 week effort
