# Summary of Changes - Game-Specific Boost Mode & Multiple FA Snippets

## Changes Made

### 1. Database Schema Update
**File:** `backend/migrations/002_add_fixture_settings.sql`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Removed hardcoded `match_day_boost_start_offset_minutes` field
- ‚úÖ Added `age_group` field (e.g., U16, U14, U12)
- ‚úÖ Added `game_size` field (e.g., 11v11, 9v9, 7v7, 5v5)
- ‚úÖ Added `half_length` field (minutes per half)
- ‚úÖ Added `quarter_length` field (optional, for younger age groups)
- ‚úÖ Split single `fa_snippet_url` into 4 separate fields:
  - `fa_snippet_fixtures_url`
  - `fa_snippet_results_url`
  - `fa_snippet_table_url`
  - `fa_snippet_team_fixtures_url`

**Why:**
- Different age groups have different match lengths (20 mins, 25 mins, 30 mins, 40 mins per half)
- Generic 90-minute boost time doesn't work for younger age groups
- FA provides 4 different embed codes for different data types
- Need to store game format to calculate accurate boost activation time

---

### 2. Match Day Scheduler Logic
**File:** `apps-script/match-day-scheduler.gs`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added `calculateBoostOffset_()` method
- ‚úÖ Updated `isInBoostMode_()` to use calculated offset instead of hardcoded 90 minutes
- ‚úÖ Calculates boost time as: `(half_length √ó 2) + 5 (break) + 5 (buffer)`
- ‚úÖ Supports quarter-based games (some younger age groups)
- ‚úÖ Logs game format and calculated offset for debugging

**Example Calculations:**
```javascript
// U16 11v11 - 40 min halves
(40 √ó 2) + 5 + 5 = 90 minutes

// U12 9v9 - 30 min halves
(30 √ó 2) + 5 + 5 = 70 minutes

// U10 7v7 - 25 min halves
(25 √ó 2) + 5 + 5 = 60 minutes

// U8 5v5 - 20 min halves
(20 √ó 2) + 5 + 5 = 50 minutes
```

**Why:**
- Now tailored to each game format instead of generic timing
- Boost mode activates at the correct time for ANY age group
- More accurate result tracking
- League table updates faster for shorter games

---

### 3. Mobile App Settings Screen
**File:** `mobile/src/screens/FixtureSettingsScreen.tsx`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Updated `FixtureSettings` interface with new fields
- ‚úÖ Replaced single FA snippet URL input with 4 separate inputs
- ‚úÖ Added new "Game Format & Match Day Boost" card section
- ‚úÖ Added age group dropdown (U6 through U18)
- ‚úÖ Added game size dropdown (5v5, 7v7, 9v9, 11v11)
- ‚úÖ Added half length numeric input
- ‚úÖ Added quarter length numeric input (optional)
- ‚úÖ Added typical kick-off time input
- ‚úÖ Added match day boost toggle
- ‚úÖ Shows calculated boost time in info chip
- ‚úÖ Added helper text with typical values for each game size
- ‚úÖ Imported `@react-native-picker/picker` for dropdown menus
- ‚úÖ Added new styles for pickers, section dividers, labels, info chips

**User Experience:**
- Customer configures game format once in app settings
- System automatically calculates correct boost time
- Clear helper text guides user on typical values
- Visual feedback shows when boost mode will activate
- All 4 FA snippet URLs have dedicated fields

**Why:**
- Customer configures everything in one place (mobile app)
- No need to touch Google Sheets or Apps Script
- Easy to update when age group or format changes
- Visual interface is more user-friendly than text config

---

### 4. Configuration Files
**File:** `backend/wrangler.toml`

**Changes:**
- ‚úÖ Added D1 database binding with placeholder for database_id
- ‚úÖ Added comment instructions for creating database

**Why:**
- Fixes "Couldn't find a D1 DB with the name or binding 'DB'" error
- User needs to create database first, then update with actual ID
- Clear instructions in comments

---

### 5. Documentation
**New File:** `UPDATED_DEPLOYMENT_STEPS.md`

**Contents:**
- ‚úÖ Step-by-step D1 database creation instructions
- ‚úÖ Updated deployment steps with game format configuration
- ‚úÖ Examples for different age groups and game formats
- ‚úÖ Explanation of how game-specific boost mode works
- ‚úÖ Troubleshooting section
- ‚úÖ Clear examples of boost time calculations

**Why:**
- Complete guide for deployment including database setup
- Explains new game-specific features
- Helps troubleshoot common issues
- Shows concrete examples for different team formats

---

## What This Solves

### Problem 1: Generic Boost Mode ‚ùå
**Before:**
```
All teams: Wait 90 minutes after kick-off
```

**Issue:**
- U8 5v5 games are only 40 minutes total (20 min halves)
- Waiting 90 minutes means boost mode never activates!
- League table doesn't update for younger age groups

**After:** ‚úÖ
```
U16 11v11: Wait 90 mins (40√ó2 + 10)
U12 9v9:   Wait 70 mins (30√ó2 + 10)
U10 7v7:   Wait 60 mins (25√ó2 + 10)
U8 5v5:    Wait 50 mins (20√ó2 + 10)
```

**Result:**
- Boost mode activates at correct time for ANY game format
- League table updates within 1-2 minutes for ALL age groups
- System is truly intelligent and tailored

---

### Problem 2: Single FA Snippet URL ‚ùå
**Before:**
```
Single field for FA snippet URL
```

**Issue:**
- FA provides 4 different embed codes (fixtures, results, table, team-specific)
- Each has different data
- Can't configure all sources

**After:** ‚úÖ
```
4 separate fields:
- Fixtures Snippet URL
- Results Snippet URL
- League Table Snippet URL
- Team Fixtures Snippet URL
```

**Result:**
- Can use all 4 FA data sources
- Better data coverage
- More reliable fixture/result tracking

---

### Problem 3: Hard to Configure ‚ùå
**Before:**
```
Customer needs to:
1. Open Google Apps Script
2. Edit Script Properties
3. Calculate boost time manually
4. Update multiple places
```

**After:** ‚úÖ
```
Customer:
1. Opens mobile app
2. Goes to Settings
3. Selects age group from dropdown
4. Selects game size from dropdown
5. Enters half length
6. Saves
```

**Result:**
- Everything configured in one place
- Visual interface with dropdowns
- System calculates boost time automatically
- No need to touch Apps Script

## Technical Details

### Boost Time Calculation

**Formula:**
```javascript
totalMatchTime = half_length √ó 2  // or quarter_length √ó 4
breakTime = 5 minutes             // half-time
buffer = 5 minutes                // injury time, delays
totalTime = totalMatchTime + breakTime + buffer
```

**Why +5 minutes buffer?**
- Accounts for injury time
- Allows for slight delays in kick-off
- Ensures we don't start boost mode too early

### Database Schema

**Before:**
```sql
match_day_boost_start_offset_minutes INTEGER DEFAULT 90
```

**After:**
```sql
age_group TEXT DEFAULT 'U16'
game_size TEXT DEFAULT '11v11'
half_length INTEGER DEFAULT 40
quarter_length INTEGER
```

### Apps Script Logic

**Before:**
```javascript
const boostStartOffset = 90; // Hardcoded
```

**After:**
```javascript
const halfLength = this.config.half_length || 40;
const boostStartOffset = (halfLength √ó 2) + 5 + 5; // Calculated
```

## Questions & Answers

**Q: What if I have multiple teams with different formats?**
A: Each tenant can configure their own game format in settings. Multi-tenant support coming soon.

**Q: What if some fixtures are different formats?**
A: Currently uses the default game format from settings for all fixtures. Per-fixture format support can be added if needed.

**Q: Do I need to update anything in Apps Script properties?**
A: No! The system reads game format from backend database automatically.

**Q: What happens if I don't configure game format?**
A: Defaults to U16, 11v11, 40-minute halves (90-minute boost time).

**Q: Can I test boost mode without waiting for a real match?**
A: Yes! In Apps Script, manually call `testMatchDayScheduler()` to see the calculations.
