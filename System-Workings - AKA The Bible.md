*Match Day*
Fixture moves into Live Match Updates tab, only on day of fixture.
Select status (kick off,ht,2nd Half ko, FT) and tick send tickbox, to send selected post to make 
Change score, add scorer/assister - send goal post (watches out for 1 goal, brace or hatrick and sends relevant post) 
If add scorer and select player ‘goal’ - opposition scored 
*minute is auto calculated from ko post/ ht / 2ns half ko / ft*
if player carded, select card colour and players name (if its opponents player that has been penalised itll just say ‘opposition')
Man of the Match - select player from dropdown 

Uses live match updates to calculate, appearances (sub), goals (pen), assists, cards and minutes.


My system should use, my emails, my fa html code snippet and the public fa website to Gather all fixtures and results. It should never duplicate information.

It should use the league fixtures (exclude cup matches) to work out the league table, can use the fa league table from their website or my snippet code, but MUST include gf ga and gd as the fa league table doesnt, use results to work this out.

Need a control panel where can turn on/off all the features 

Xbotgo, have a interactive scoreboard that can be used on a second device, I want to be able to change the score board automatically when I add a scorer. 

When I select notes from live match update it'll have a drop down of things I can mark, for the video editor. (Big chance, tackle, good play, goal) it will also have a player dropdown menu next to the notes tab so it can reference the player 

Video editor 

Would also like Highlight video to have a match clock in the corner with team names, and when a player scores a banner comes up with players name. Add a replay but zoomed in for goals 

When I pick a scorer or card, it automatically selects scorer or card in notes for the marker for editing the video.

Store all video clips in google drive, individual player clips (goals, assists, good play, skills etc) to be saved in individual player folders in google drive so can reuse them for individual player highlights, maybe for motm.

Steam live matches on facebook, youtube, instagram and tiktok?

As the season has started, i need to be able input player stats, results etc manually
Must be clever and use only free tools, must be written in a way that stays under make,coms free allowance or any other tool i use.

Should have separate .gs file for each feature, for organisation and easy error fixing.
