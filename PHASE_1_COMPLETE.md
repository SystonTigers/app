## Known Limitations

### Using Mock Data
All three new screens currently use mock data:
- League table shows 10 sample teams
- Stats shows 10 sample players
- Settings shows default preferences

**To connect real data:**
1. Add backend API endpoints (see APP_TABS_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for endpoint specs)
2. Update screens to call API instead of using mock data
3. Add authentication/authorization

### Navigation
9 tabs is a lot for bottom navigation. Consider:
- Using drawer navigation for "More" section
- Grouping related tabs
- Implementing the recommended structure from the plan

**Recommended structure:**
- Bottom Tabs: Home, Fixtures, Stats, Videos, More, Manage
- "More" drawer: Table, Gallery, Highlights, Payments, Shop, Settings

This can be refactored in a future update.
