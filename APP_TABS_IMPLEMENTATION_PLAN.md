## Out of Scope (Backend/Integration Work)

These are mentioned in spec but are backend/automation work, not mobile app:

- Google Sheets control panel setup
- Apps Script triggers and functions
- Make.com/n8n workflow configuration
- GitHub Pages website generation
- Cloudflare Workers queue consumers (already built)
- XbotGo hardware integration
- Canva API integrations

---

## Questions for Clarification

1. **Navigation**: Should we use drawer navigation for the "More" section, or stick with tabs?
2. **Priority**: Which phase should we start with? (Recommend Phase 1)
3. **Backend**: Do you want me to also build the backend API endpoints, or focus on mobile UI only?
4. **Integrations**: Google Sheets, Apps Script, Make.com - are these separate projects or part of mobile app scope?

**Ready to start building Phase 1!**

Starting with:
1. League Table screen
2. Stats screen
3. Settings screen (location-aware notifications)
