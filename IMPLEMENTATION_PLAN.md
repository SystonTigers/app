## Executive Summary

The Syston Football automation system has been successfully migrated to a **Cloudflare Workers + Queues** architecture with 82% completion. The core infrastructure is production-ready, with all critical API endpoints functional, queue processing operational, and comprehensive CI/CD pipelines deployed.

**Key Achievement:** Post Bus architecture fully operational with Make.com fallback providing complete feature coverage while direct integrations are being completed.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components (82%)

**Backend Worker (90%)**
- HTTP API with 10 endpoints operational
- JWT authentication with jose library
- Rate limiting via Durable Objects (5 req/sec)
- Idempotency with KV storage (24h TTL)
- Queue-based async processing
- Make.com adapter 100% functional

**Apps Script Integration (90%)**
- 110+ files with comprehensive automation
- ConsentGate privacy engine
- Fixture management and scheduling
- Make.com webhook orchestration

**CI/CD Pipeline (100%)**
- Backend deployment via Wrangler
- Apps Script deployment via clasp
- Nightly synthetics and health checks
- Automated contract validation

### ⚠️ Critical Gaps

1. **Admin Endpoints (0%)** - Tenant management requires manual KV manipulation
2. **Fixtures Worker Deployment (95%)** - Implementation complete, needs wrangler.toml
3. **YouTube Direct (30%)** - Stub only, Make.com fallback operational

See IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md for detailed component breakdown.
