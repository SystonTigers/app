# Historical Fixtures Feature

## üéØ What This Feature Does

**Automatically posts previous season results against upcoming fixtures - but ONLY if historical data exists. If no previous meetings found, it skips the post (no spam!).**

### Key Behavior:
- ‚úÖ **Has History**: Posts detailed head-to-head comparison with stats
- ‚ùå **No History**: Skips post entirely (first-time opponents)
- üîÑ **Fallback**: If no historical data, posts general team stats instead

---

## üìÖ When It Runs

### Automatic Schedule
- **Every Wednesday**: As part of the weekly content calendar
- **Integration**: Built into the Bible-compliant weekly scheduler
- **Context**: "Wednesday: Player stats (Monthly) / Previous matches vs opponent"

### Manual Triggers
- `postHistoricalForNextMatch()` - Check all upcoming fixtures
- `postHistoricalForOpponent("Team Name")` - Specific opponent
- `getHistoricalDataReport()` - See which teams have history
